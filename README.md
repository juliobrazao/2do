# 2DO List
A todo list using only VanillaJS

## Reason
I developed this SPA to help my wife to create supermarket lists without a need of paper and pen.

### How it works?
This project uses the browser's LocalStorage to save all data you insert, and create distinction about status of (done/plan) based on content preffix, all this logic you can check on ```brain.js```
file.

### URL

### What I learned
1 - LocalStorage

2 - Web Manifest

3 - Responsive Design w/ Bootstrap
